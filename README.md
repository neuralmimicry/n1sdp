# ARM N1SDP Neoverse Development Platform scripts
No Warranty provided. Use the code as-is.

Use the build_n1sdp_podman.sh to build the latest firmware and initial OS image.

Use the merge_kernels.sh to take the N1SDP quirks from kernel 6.6.10 and mix them in to 6.8.11 so that Ubuntu 24.04 can be used with NVidia 565 drivers (and CUDA).

Whilst I'm happy to chat about the scripts I cannot guarantee that I have any extra time to make changes to them.
